# Setting up

This is for a personal Mac setup. For work stuff, I might do a completely
different boostrap process, or find some way to share the common bits.

1. Install Xcode
2. Install Command Line Tools
3. Agree to agreement
4. Git clone this repository into your home folder (`~/dotfiles`)
5. `cd` to `dotfiles`
6. `./mac/mac_setup.sh`, wait for password prompts at the end
7. Boot karabiner
8. Setup up syncthing

## TODO

- Add script for add `userChrome.css` to Firefox
