# Setting up

This is for a personal Mac setup. For work stuff, I might do a completely
different boostrap process, or find some way to share the common bits.

1. Install Xcode
1. Install Command Line Tools (`xcode-select -install`)
1. Agree to agreement
1. Git clone this repository into your home folder (`~/dotfiles`)
1. `cd` to `dotfiles`
1. `./mac/mac_setup.sh`, wait for password prompts at the end
1. Boot karabiner

## TODO

- Add script for add `userChrome.css` to Firefox
